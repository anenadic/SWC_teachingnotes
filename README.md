# SWC Teaching Notes

Before I teach a [Software Carpentry Lesson](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons/), I got through the materials and write out pretty much everything I'm going to say. Then, I share this with any co-instructors I may have. 

Here are the one's I created so far with a link to the actual lesson.
