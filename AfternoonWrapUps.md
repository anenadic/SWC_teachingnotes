#Afternoon Wrap-Ups

## Day 1

###Questions
What have we just learned?
Are you prepared for tomorrow?

###Homework 
1. Read the [operations guide](https://software-carpentry.org/workshops/operations/)
2. Install the base software carpentry software. Directions for installs on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux can be found [here](http://swcarpentry.github.io/workshop-template/)

As homework overnight, please read our [operations guide](https://software-carpentry.org/workshops/operations/) and the checklists it links to. These recommendations and how-to guides summarize what we have learned (often the hard way) about organizing and running workshops. When you arrive tomorrow, we will ask you to add one question about our operations to a list; we will then do our best to answer all of those questions during the day.

If you haven’t done so already, please also follow the [setup instructions](http://swcarpentry.github.io/workshop-template/) to install the software that we use when we teach in a typical workshop. You will need this for tomorrow’ live coding exercise, and it will also give you first-hand knowledge of what we ask our learners to do.

###One Up One Down Exercise
We frequently ask workshop participants to give us feedback at the end of each day using a technique called “one up, one down”. The instructor asks the learners to alternately give one positive and one negative point about the day, without repeating anything that has already been said. This requirement forces people to say things they otherwise might not: once all the “safe” feedback has been given, participants will start saying what they really think.

When called upon by the instructor, add one positive or one negative point to the growing list without repeating anything that has already been said. The instructors will record these in the etherpad. 

## Day 2

### Questions
1. What have we learned?
2. What do you need to do now to become a certified instructor. 


### Becoming A Certified Instructor

The final steps in qualifying as an instructor are to:

1.  take part in a [discussion session](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion) with experienced instructors, 
2. Make a contribution to a lesson's content, exercises, or instructor's guide by doing **one of the following three tasks**:
  1. Submitting a change request to fix an existing issue
  2. Proof-reading a lesson and adding a new issue describing something to be improved
  3. Providing substantive feedback on an existing issue or PR
3.  do a 5-minute live coding demo.


[This page](http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/) explains the procedure in detail; please review it with your instructor before you leave.
