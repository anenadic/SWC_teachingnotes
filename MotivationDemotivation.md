#Motivation and Demotivation

This next session is about motivation and demotivation.

## 1. Classify Skills According to time required to master and utility once mastered. 
People learn best when they are passionate about learning the topic. We are oftening teaching computational skills to people he computation as mearly a means to and end. They aren't necessarily thrilled about coding, they just know they have to. 

Imagine a figure with time to master on the x and utility once mastere on the why. In software carpentry and data carpentry, our moto is "first teach the things that can be quickly mastered and are immediately useful". We explicitly do not teach the things that are hard to master and aren't (broadly) very useful.

We try to have learners do something that is useful within the first 15 of each lesson. This will motivate them and boost their confidence, which will help them get over humps when working topics that are harder to master.

Example: rather than having students print "hello word" or summing the first 10 integers, you can have student open and save a copy of a file that is commonly used in their particular domain of science. Or, Steve Haddock from the Haddock and Dunn book told me he teaches regular expression because these are useful right away!!  http://pad.software-carpentry.org/swc-lab-meeting-2016-05-10 

### Exercise: 
Think something you did this week (wrote a function, bulk downloaded data, did some stats in R, forked a repo)? If you were to use this an an exercise in class, where would it fit on a the plot of "time to master" versus useful". Share the answer with your partner. 

Have you ever taken a class where the professor spent way to long teaching you a "really cool trick" that you found useless? By evaluating the utility and time to master, you can avoid this in your classroom.


## 2. Identify Motivational Strategies used in a lesson.
Let me give you an example. In the Unix lesson, we teach grep with a haiku. Its a great didatic tool, but it can be hard for people to see how to translate that to their research. For bioinformatics folks, after we cover multiple flags in grep, I show them a one liner that combines head, grep, sort, and unique to produce a ranked list of the most abundant sequences. This way, I connect my users with domain-specific examples using an authentic task that is relevant to their research.  

### Exercise: 
Think/pair/share
- Think back to a computational course you took. Identify one thing the instructor did that motivated you. Discuss it with your partner. One person from each site share.


Summarize
- Establish value
	- connect with domain-specific examples
	- provide authentic tasks
	- show relevance to research
	- show passion and enthusiam
- Build positive expectations
	- ensure objectives and assessment is aligned
	- identify appropriate challenges
	- provide early success opportunities
	- articulate expectations
	- provide rubrics
	- describe effective study strategies
- Promote Self-efficacy
	- provide flexibility and control
	- give students the opportunity to reflect	
	
	
## 3. Demotivation
A few common demotivators are indifference and unfairness. We want to make sure that students know that we care about them and that we will treat everyone in the classroom fairly.  Its also important not to put on airs, which could indicate that you think that you are better than they are. 

- Things you should NOT do
	- bash windows, word, Excell, mac, windows, another other language or processing system. Be aware that they all have their pros and cons. 
	- delve into complex/detailed technical discussion with a few learners, isolating the rest.  * greg suggests holding off really specific questions til the end. write on the board then address later
	- pretend you know more than you do
	- use the word "just" to talk about how easy something is
	- feign surprise that someone hasn't heard of something before

We have a code of conduct. https://software-carpentry.org/conduct/	


Mindset is also a demotivator.

If people believe that competence in some area is intrinsic, they figure they just don’t have that aptitude, which biases future performance. On the other hand, if people believe that a skill is learned and can be improved, they do better on average. A person’s mindset can be shaped by subtle cues. For example, if a child is told, “You did a good job, you must be very smart,” she is likely to develop a fixed mindset. If on the other hand she is told, “You did a good job, you must have worked very hard,” she is likely to develop a growth mindset, and subsequently achieve more. Studies have also shown that the simple action of telling learners about the different mindsets before a course can improve learning outcomes for the whole group. 
	
### Exercise: 1 of 2
1. Have any of the above de-motivated you? How could that have been handled differently?
2. What other things did I not mention were demotivators? What happened? What could have been done differently?	


## 4. Stereotype threat
The biggest negative stereotypes in computing are gender-related. Depending on whose numbers you trust, only 12-18% of programmers are women. But there are plenty of others related to ethnicity, socio-economic status, previous experience, sexual orientation, and more. 

Here are some strategies for mitigating stereotype threat.
- Change the way you give critical feedback. By giving group level feedback versus person-specific feedback, you can improve its members’ trust, comfort, and performance 
- Foster inter-group conversations among students from differing backgrounds to improve minority students’ comfort and grades in a setting
- Help students develop a narrative about the setting that explains their frustrations while projecting positive engagement and success in the setting to greatly improve their sense of belonging and achievement

A few concrete teaching strategies  to implement these ideas are:
 - Increase inter-group interaction.
 - Remind students of their identities linked to academic success.
 - Expose students to positive, successful role models from their group.
 - Support students’ sense of belonging.
 - Give feedback emphasizing your high standards while assuring that students can meet those expectations.
 
 
 
## 5. Imposter Syndrome
Impostor syndrome is the belief that one is not good enough for a job or position.

Two ways of dealing with your own impostor syndrome are:
1. Ask for feedback from someone you respect and trust. Ask them for their honest thoughts on your strengths and achievements, and commit to believing them.
2. Look for role models. Who do you know who presents as confident and capable? Think about how they conduct themselves. What lessons can you learn from them? What habits can you borrow? 

As an instructor, you can help people with their impostor syndrome by sharing stories of mistakes that you have made or things you struggled to learn. This reassures the class that it’s OK to find topics hard.

You can also emphasize that you want questions: you are not succeeding as a teacher if no one can follow your class, so you’re asking students for their help to help you learn and improve. 

Never go alone!!! One way to support at-risk learners of all kinds is to have people sign up for workshops in small teams. When people sign up in groups, they will be with at least be in the room with a few people they trust, which increases the chances of them actually coming. Bonus: It helps build community after the workshop.

###Exercise: On your own time 

Read the testimonials from other instructors, and then write a short explanation of what motivates you to volunteer to teach. This will be good for you to do before you teach a workshop but also to include in your teaching statment. http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/guide/#testimonials

## 6. Accessibility
How often do you press the "handicap button" to open a door when you are pushing a large cart or carrying a million things? As an event planner, I do this all the time, and even though I'm not handicapped, I know exactly which doors are handicap accessible and which are not all over my campus.  Likewise, I'm not a vegetarian, but I try to have veggie options for lunch. 

While it may not be possible to accommodate everyone’s needs, it is possible to get a good working structure in place without any specific knowledge of what specific disabilities people might have. Having at least some accommodations prepared in advance also makes it clear that hosts and instructors care enough to have thought about problems in advance, and that any additional concerns are likely to be addressed.

When hosting a workshop, thing about the little things you can do to accomodate the learners, whether it large font for serving hot water instead of coffee. Is there parking for people who will have to drive? Wifi for those who aren't members? By showing that you have thought of these things, you show the learners that you care about their access to these resources. 

## 7. Recap and Key Points:
- People learn best when they are intrinsically motivated.
- The two biggest demotivators are indifference and unfairness.
- Teach what's most immediately useful first in order to gain learners' trust.
- Be careful not to remind learners of negative stereotypes when teaching.
- Teaching and learning in groups helps foster community and success
- Belief that competence comes with practice improves learning outcomes.
- Measures taken to improve accessibility aid everyone.
