# Expertise and Memory

##Questions
- How can we describe the difference in learning between a novice and expert?
- How is memory a limiting factor in learning?
- How expertise can be helpful and harmful?

##Objectives
- Explain how key aspects of expert behavior are results of cognitive differences between experts and competent practitioners.
- Construct a concept map for a short lesson showing the lesson's key ideas and the relationships between them.
- Understand the prior knowledge can be helpful or harmful

##Connectivity
One important way that experts and novices differ is in how they organize information learned. Novices often fail to see the relationship between things that are actually connected (like events happening at the same time in different parts of the world, or how different organ systems in the body interact, or how Unix command can be linked with pipes or scripts). However, experts often aware of the many connections between facts, concepts, and skills they know.

This figure (https://github.com/swcarpentry/instructor-training/issues/98) provides an illustration of how novices (A, B) and experts (C, D) organize information. The expert’s knowledge structure is characterized by a dense connections between nodes while the novice organized information is discrete units or a chain of associations

If we provide students with an organization scheme for making connections, they can begin to form more meaning associations between related concepts. Here, we will explore two ways we can help students increase the density of connections between objects. 

As instructors, we can present or have the students make concept makes that explicitly link related skills, theories, facts, etc. When observing students concept maps, look for and diagnose inappropriate connections that could be impeding the student’s performance or understanding. We can also use, “chuncking” (grouping bits of knowledge) is one process by which learners create a highly organized knowledge structure, which allows them to develop exceptional memory ability and to recall a great deal of information. 

##Concept map examples

1. Choosing a good chart http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/fig/05/choosing-a-good-chart-09.pdf

2. ggplot2 cheatsheet - the expert can write a command to draw a beautiful plot, but the novice will need to refer to these concept maps for help building the command http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf

3. Let's look at the relationship between touch rm mv mkdir and rmdir rm -r

The abover example was created by my colleage. I created this one.

##Concept map exercise
1. Create a hand drawn concept map for something you would teach in five minutes. (Possibly for the same subject that you used to create a multiple choice question before.)
2. Get in groups of two or three. One person will speak while another one films. 
3. One presenter will explain their concept map in < 5 min while someone else in the group films it.
4. The presenter will listen to the feedback from their group members.
5. Watch the video together and see if you pick up on anything else.
6. Repeat steps 3 - 5 for each person in the group.


##Concept map wrap-up
Concepts maps can be used in many ways in lesson design and execution:
1. To aid **lesson design**. This is a way to look at the concept in a non-linear fashion. You can get it all out on paper then decide what order to teach things.
2. To aid **communication with co-teachers**. This allows you to see where efforts are focused and where there are gaps or discrepancies in what teachers think are important.
3. To aid **communication with learners**. While it’s possible to give learners a pre-drawn map at the start of a lesson for them to annotate, it’s better to draw it piece by piece while teaching to reinforce the ties between what’s in the map and what the instructor said. 
4. To **formatively assess learners**. Having learners draw concept maps of what they think they just heard shows the instructor what was missed and what was mis-understood. Reviewing the learners’ concept maps might be too time-consuming for use in workshops, but very useful in weekly lectures once learners are familiar with the technique.
 
Concept maps are a useful way to organize one’s thoughts before putting together a talk or writing a paper or at the end of a group meeting. As with lessons, they allow us to externalize cognition (i.e., to get our thoughts out where we can see them and see the contradictions that have happily been swimming around inside our heads without bumping into each other).

##Seven plus or minus two
Memory can be divided into two major categories: long-term or persistent memory and short-term or working memory. Long-term memory is our brain's system for storing, managing, and retrieving information about people, places, things, events, processes, etc. Short-term memory is the very short time that you keep something in mind before either dismissing it or transferring it to long-term memory.

In 1956, Miller estimated that the average adult’s working memory could hold 7±2 items for a few seconds before things started to drop out. This is why phone numbers are typically 7 or 8 digits long (from back when phones had dials instead of keypads, that was the longest string of numbers most adults could remember accurately for as long as it took the dial to go around and around). It’s also why sports teams tend to have about half a dozen members, or be broken down into smaller groups (such as the forwards and backs in rugby).

7±2 is probably the most important number in programming. When someone is trying to type at the command line, she needs to keep a bunch of arbitrary facts straight in her head: what does this variable represent, what value does it currently hold, etc. If the number of facts grows too large, her mental model of the program comes crashing down (something we have all experienced).

7±2 is also the most important number in teaching. An instructor cannot push information directly into a learner’s long-term memory. Instead, whatever she presents is first represented in the learner’s short-term memory, and is only transferred to long-term memory after it has been held there and rehearsed. If we present too much information too quickly, the new will displace the old before it has a chance to consolidate in long-term memory.

This is why it’s very important to use a technique like concept mapping a lesson before teaching it - an instructor needs to identify just how many pieces of separate information will need to be “stored” in memory as part of the lesson.

##Chunking
Our minds can store larger numbers of facts in short-term memory by creating chunks (aka chuncking. For example, most of us will remember a word we read as a single item, rather than as a sequence of letters. Similarly, the pattern made by five spots on cards or dice is remembered as a whole rather than as five separate pieces of information. Chunks allow us to manage larger problems, but can also mislead us if we mis-identify something, i.e., see it as something it isn’t.

##Never use the J Word
Experts often betray their blind spots by using the word “just” in explanations, as in, “Oh, it’s easy, you just fire up a new virtual machine and just install these four patches to Ubuntu — no problem.” The J word (also sometimes called the passive dismissive adjective) is banned in our workshops, primarily because using it gives learners the very clear signal that the instructor thinks their problem is trivial and that they therefore must be stupid.

##Key Points

- Experts' mental models are much more densely connected than those of non-experts.
- Expert blind spot: knowing something so well that it seems easy when it's not.
- Can represent mental models using concept maps.
- Relationships are as important as concepts.
- Most adults can store 7±2 items in short-term memory for a few seconds before loss.
- Things seen together repeatedly are remembered (or mis-remembered) in chunks.
- Teaching consists of loading short-term memory and reinforcing it long enough for items to be transferred to long-term memory.
- Lesson episodes should not overload short-term memory.
