########################### Overview ############################

This is the script I use when teaching workshop.

- Each 3 hour block of a workshop is marked with long strings of `######`
- All lines marked with `##` are large headers that pasted in the etherpad before the session begins 
- All other lines of text are pasted into the etherpad in real time (maybe with some bolding, maybe not), right before I say them outloud. These lines of text serve as my main talking points. All the words I use come from the main lesson materials, which I keep in view on my screen.
- All prompts to myself that I do not pasted in the etherpad are *recorded in italics*

For my setup, I have open my notes file, the etherpad, the current episode webpage, any webpages I want to present, and (for online workshops) blue jeans.

For most exercises, I past all the students names in the blank space below the question prompt and clear the color coding. This gives a student a place to put their answer and gives me the ability to see who has and has not completed the exercise yet.

## Welcome 

Introductions set the stage for learning. - Tracy Teal, Executive Director, Data Carpentry

*Introduce yourself and the other instructors*

*2 minute exercise*
Please write down your name, the best class you ever took (or one class from your top ten, if you can’t decide), and what made it so great.

This two-day workshop has two goals:
- Introduce y'all to a handful of key research findings and show how they can be used to help people learn better and faster.
- Introduce y'all to the teaching practices that have been adopted by the Software and Data Carpentry communities, and the overall philosophy and procedures of both organizations in order to prepare them to teach at Software and Data Carpentry workshops.

*5 minute exercise*
Exercise: Assessing Trainee Motivation and Prior Knowledge
Place an "X" beside the statment that most accurately describes you or your option. 

Have you ever participated in a Software Carpentry or Data Carpentry Workshop?
- Yes, I have taken a workshop.
- Yes, I have been a workshop helper.
- Yes, I organized a workshop.
- No, but I am familiar with what is taught at a workshop.
- No, and I am not familiar with what is taught at a workshop.

Which of these most accurately describes your teaching experience?
- I have been a graduate or undergraduate teaching assistant for a university/college course.
- I have not had any teaching experience in the past.
- I have taught a seminar, workshop, or other short or informal course.
- I have been the instructor-of-record for my own university/college course.
- I have taught at the K-12 level.

Which of these questions assesses flaws in a student's mental model of a domain?
- I'm not sure what a mental model is.

	- (a) '12' 
	- (b) TypeError 
	- (c) ‘3’ 
	- (d) 3

## Novices and Formative Assessment

Novices, Competent Practitioners, and Experts
- Novice: a learner who doesn't know what they don't know (e.g. doesn't know they color coding in Excell can be read into R or python)
- Competent practitioner: a learner who knows a good amount and is also aware of what they don't know (e.g. car owners have a basic understand of how the car works under hood)
- Expert: a learner who understand concepts in complete details

Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry assume that all learners in our workshops are novices. We help them build a structure on which they can build and then learn more details. 

*Exercise*
Exercise: Your mental models
What is your primary research domain or speciality/expertise?  What is one mental model you use to frame and understand your work?  

*Exercise*
Exercise: Manuals vs. Tutorials  
What’s the difference between a manual and a tutorial? (Think in terms of the differences between novices and competent practitioners.) Can one document do a good job of being both?

Two types of assessment:
- Summative assessment (e.g. the final exam, the driving examine to get your driver's license)
- Formative assessment (e.g. real-time feedback about performace of playing the piano). Must be very fast and rapid. Quick to administer and quick to evaluate


Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) - For good MCQs, the goal is not to trick the learner but to asses miscconception

MCQ: what is 27 + 15 ?
a) 42: the answer to life, the universe, and everything?
b) 32
c) 312
d) 33

*Exercise*
Exercise: Identify the misconception
Describe is the misconception associated with each wrong answer (distractor)?

*Exercise*
Exercise: Handling Outcomes
1. As the instructor, what should you do if most of the class votes for one of the wrong answers?  2. For the right answer?  3. What if the votes are evenly spread between options?

Watch this one minute YouTube video with peer-peer instruction: https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1&v=2LbuoxAy56o

*Exercise ~15 min?*
Exercise: Modeling Novice Mental Models
Create a multiple choice question related to a topic you intend to teach and explain the diagnostic power of each its distractors (i.e., what misconception is each distractor meant to identify?)

## Day 2 Morning Overview
- 09:30/08:30 Live Coding - Aim: 15 min Rayna talking 45 minutes of activity

## Live Coding

Goal: Undertand why we teach programming using live coding.

The UNIX shell for loop lesson: http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/05-loop/
The objective of this lesson is for students to learn to write a loop that applies one or more commands separately to each file in a set of files.

Note: This lesson serves as both a script for the instructor and a tutorial for the learner. 

Quote: "Teaching is theatre not cinema." - Neal Davis

Exercise: Evaluate your peer's live coding effectiveness
1. Watch this video of poor live coding: https://youtu.be/bXxBeNkKmJE
2. Watch this video of good live coding: https://youtu.be/SkPmwe_WjeY
3. Create a list of "do's and don'ts" for live coding that you would like to emulate or avoid in your own live coding practice.

Don'ts  

Do's
