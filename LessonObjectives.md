# Lessons and Objectives

## Questions
1. How can I design more effective lessons?
2. What lessons do Software and Data Carpentry currently contain?

## Objectives
1. Describe the four steps in reverse instructional design and explain why following them is an efficient way to create good teaching materials.
2. Follow the steps in the reverse instructional design process to create a short lesson.
3. Analyze a lesson by comparing it to the elements of WHERETO.
4. Describe the characteristics of a good learning objective and correctly state whether a learning objective meets those criteria.
5. Summarize the existing Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry lessons.

Classify the level of a learning objective in terms of Bloom's taxonomy and similar cognitive hierarchies.
Write a learner profile describing a typical member of their intended audience.

## Writing learning objectives
Summative and formative assessments help instructors figure out what they’re going to teach. In order to communicate that to learners and other instructors, we should also write learning objectives. It’s easy to come up with fuzzy ones like, “Learners will gain an appreciation of the role of research software engineers in the research process.” Useful ones take a bit more work.

What we want are specific, verifiable descriptions of what learners can do to demonstrate their learning. Each learning objective should have a measurable or verifiable verb specifying what the learner will do, and should specify the criteria for acceptable performance. For example, a better learning objective than the one above would be, “Learners will list three things that make research software engineers distinct from other specialists involved in the research process.”

In order to formulate good learning objectives we need to decide what kinds of learning we are aiming for. For example, do we wants students to diagnose why a microscope isn’t focusing properly and to design a new microscope that focuses more easily. These two things require vastly different learning skills. 

## Bloom's Taxonomy 
Bloom's taxonomy is a set of three hierarchical models used to classify educational learning objectives into levels of complexity and specificity. This table shows the cognitive domain or knowledge-based domain of learning and provides examples of typical learning objective verbs that address each level.

### Exercise: Think, pair, and share to evaluate SWC and DC learning objects

The following learning objectives were taken from actual SWC and DC lesson. Pick one of the 
1. Pick one of the learning objectives listed below. 
2. Identify the learning objective verb. 
3. Decide what type of learning outcome this applies to (i.e. comprehension, application, evaluation)
4. Reword the learning objective for a different learning outcome (i.d. from application to knowledge based outcome or vice versa). 
5. Pair up to discuss your rewording. 
6. Share your re-worded learning objectives in the Etherpad.
