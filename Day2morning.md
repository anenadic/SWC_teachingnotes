### Live Coding

Goal: Undertand why we teach programming using live coding.

The UNIX shell for loop lesson: http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/05-loop/
The objective of this lesson is for students to learn to write a loop that applies one or more commands separately to each file in a set of files.

Note: This lesson serves as both a script for the instructor and a tutorial for the learner. 

Quote: "Teaching is theatre not cinema." - Neal Davis

Exercise: Evaluate your peer's live coding effectiveness
1. Watch this video of poor live coding: https://youtu.be/bXxBeNkKmJE
2. Watch this video of good live coding: https://youtu.be/SkPmwe_WjeY
3. Create a list of "do's and don'ts" for live coding that you would like to emulate or avoid in your own live coding practice.

Don'ts  

Do's

Exercise: Live coding in groups of two or three
1. One person teach 3 minutes of a chosen lesson episode using live coding. Another group members sets a timer for 3 minutes.  
2. Repeat step 1 for all group members.
3. Give feed back to your group members feedback using the 2x2 method for content/delivery postive/negative.
4. Summarize the feedback you received in the etherpad.

## The Carpentries
Software Carpentry (SWC) website: https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/
Data Carpentry (DC) website: http://www.datacarpentry.org/

Your questions here:

History
SWC - Founded in by 1998 by Brent Gorda and Greg Wilson
DC - Founded in 2013 by Tracy Teal 

Shared goals and approach:
- Goal: fill gaps in computational training for researchers 
- Goal: increase condience/motivation of learners to enable future learning
- Approach: Volunteers teach 12-hr workshops around the globe

SWC vs. DC
- better programming skills vs. better data management/analysis/visualization skills
- domain/subject agnostic vs. domain/subject specific
- modular curriculum vs dataset- and language-driven curriculum
- version control required vs version control not required

A sense of community

Exercise: Live coding in groups of two or three. 
1. One person teach 3 minutes of a chosen lesson episode using live coding. Another group members sets a timer for 3 minutes.  
2. Repeat step 1 for all group members.
3. Give feed back to your group members feedback, this time thinking about how it was different. What improved and what did not?
4. Summarize the feedback you received in the etherpad. 
How was the experience different?
What was improved?
What did not improve?

## Carpentry Practices

Your questions here:

Some key practices
- Communicate that lessons are aimed towards novices 
- All lessons are open assess and freely available under a permissive open license: https://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/license/
- Distribute a pre-assessment questionnaire to get a sense of skill diversity
- Provide multiple challenge questions to appease a range of learners
- All workshops have at least 2 instructors and have ~1 helper per 10 learners
- Red and green sticky notes for formative assessment
- Learners use their own machines
- Collaborative lesson design complete with: 
	- instructor notes: http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/guide/
	- issues: https://github.com/swcarpentry/shell-novice/issues
	- pull requests: https://github.com/swcarpentry/shell-novice/pulls
- Collaborative note taking with Etherpad (or sometimes Google Docs)
	- http://pad.software-carpentry.org/2017-03-05-ucsf-python
	- http://pad.software-carpentry.org/2017-03-05-ucsf-r
	- http://pad.software-carpentry.org/2017-02-09-farmington (Data Carpentry Genomics)
- Code of conduct
- We are not a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC)

Teaching Practice Discussion
List one the Carpentries Teaching practices that your really like and/or are excited to use.

Complete in 2 min and we will discuss for 3 min.
